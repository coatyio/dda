//
// This API enables application components to share distributed state with each
// other by use of an underlying consensus protocol, like Raft or Paxos, that
// guarantees strong consistency.
//
// This API maintains a replicated state in a state synchronization group that
// is formed by all associated agents in a DDA cluster that are configured as
// state group members. State changes can be observed and proposed by members of
// the group. Replicated state is represented as a key-value store. Whereas keys
// are strings, values can be any application-specific binary encoding. You may
// partition the overall state into multiple application-specific use cases by
// providing a unique key prefix for each one.
//
// Replicated state can be modified with [ProposeInput] to propose new input
// that should be applied to the replicated state. Applied state changes can be
// observed with [ObserveStateChange].
//
// All members of a state synchronization group can monitor the lifecycle of
// each other by [ObserveMembershipChange] emitting new membership change
// information whenever a member is joining or leaving the group.
//
// Note that Api implementations are meant to be thread-safe and individual Api
// interface methods may be run on concurrent goroutines.
