// Api is an interface for local persistent or in-memory key-value storage to be
// provided by a single DDA sidecar or instance. The storage API is implemented
// by storage bindings that use specific underlying embedded, i.e. file-based
// storage systems, like Pebble, LevelDB, RocksDB, BoltDB, SQLite, and others.
// Storage uses a key-value data model where keys are strings and values are
// represented as arbitrary binary data. Such embedded storage is typically
// implemented using B+ Trees for read-intensive workloads and log-structured
// merge trees (LSM) with write ahead log (WAL) for write-intensive workloads.
// You may choose a storage binding that best fits your application's needs.
//
// The API supports basic key-value store operations such as Get, Set, and
// Delete, deleting all or a range of keys, as well as iterating over keys using
// prefix and range scans.
//
// Note that Api implementations are meant to be thread-safe and individual Api
// interface methods may be run on concurrent goroutines. However, thread safety
// across multiple API methods, such as in read-modify-write-loops, must be
// realized by the application. ACID transactions are not supported.
//
// Note that local storage is not designed to be shared among multiple DDA
// sidecars or instances, even if they run on the same host.
