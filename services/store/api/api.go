// The API supports basic key-value store operations such as Get, Set, and
// Delete, deleting all or a range of keys, as well as iterating over keys using
// prefix and range scans.
//
// Note that Api implementations are meant to be thread-safe and individual Api
// interface methods may be run on concurrent goroutines. However, thread safety
// across multiple API methods, such as in read-modify-write-loops, must be
// realized by the application. ACID transactions are not supported.
//
// Note that local storage is not designed to be shared among multiple DDA
// sidecars or instances, even if they run on the same host.
